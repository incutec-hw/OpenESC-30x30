# OpenESC-30x30

Open-source 4-in-1 BLDC ESC with a 30.5 × 30.5 mm mounting pattern, built around four independent AT32F421 motor controllers running AM32. Six-layer, DShot over the standard 8-pin connector. Designed in KiCad for JLCPCB assembly.

Part of the incutec OpenDrone line (`incutec-hw/OpenESC-30x30`).

> A smaller **[OpenESC_20X20](https://github.com/incutec-hw/OpenESC_20X20)** (20×20 mm) shares this design and mirrors this repo. The two differ only in board/mounting size and a few power-stage parts.

## Architecture

Four fully independent ESC channels share a common power input and telemetry connector. Each channel has its own MCU and gate driver; the high-current stage is six MOSFETs per channel (three half-bridges). This is the distributed-MCU AM32 4-in-1 topology rather than a single-MCU design. Values below are extracted from the KiCad design files (`hardware/4in1.kicad_sch`, `hardware/ESC.kicad_sch`, `hardware/4in1.kicad_pcb`) and the production BOM (`hardware/production/Rev1-30x30_bom.csv`).

| Block | Part | LCSC | Per board |
|---|---|---|---|
| Motor MCU | AT32F421G8U7 (QFN-28) | C2765098 | 4 |
| Gate driver | NSG2065Q (QFN-24) | C41414478 | 4 |
| Power MOSFETs | SP40N01GHNK PDFN-8L (5×6) | C22385416 | 24 (6 per channel) |

## Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Channels | 4 independent BLDC channels |
| MCU | AT32F421G8U7 (ARM Cortex-M4, QFN-28), one per channel |
| Gate driver | NSG2065Q (QFN-24, FD6288Q-compatible), one per channel |
| Power MOSFETs | SP40N01GHNK, N-channel, PDFN-8L (5×6), 24 total (XRS280N03C selected as drop-in next-gen — not yet swapped) |
| Current sense | Board-level high-side: INA186A3IDCKR (100 V/V, SC-70-6) across 2× 0.2 mΩ 2512 shunts in parallel (0.1 mΩ) in the +BATT feed → 10 mV/A → ~330 A full-scale at 3.3 V ADC |
| Input | +BATT direct from connector/pads, 3S–6S |
| Input protection | 3× SMBJ24A TVS (24 V standoff) |
| Buck regulator | LMR54406DBVR (SOT-23-6) + FTC160808S4R7MBCA 4.7 µH inductor → +10 V gate-drive rail (FB 115k/10k, Vref 0.8 V → 10.0 V) |
| LDO | TLV76733DRVR (WSON-6) → +3V3 (MCUs, sensing), from +10 V |
| Signal protocol | DShot (4 independent signal lines, one per channel) |
| Firmware | AM32 (per-channel AT32F421 target, flashed individually) |
| PCB | 6-layer, 1.69 mm |
| Mounting pattern | 30.5 × 30.5 mm, 4× Ø4.0 mm holes (M3) |

Current/voltage ratings are not printed on the design files. The input clamp is set by the SMBJ24A TVS (24 V standoff → 3S–6S); the MOSFET (SP40N01GHNK) and current-sense full-scale (~330 A) set the practical envelope. Characterize before quoting a hard rating.

## Connector

8-pin JST **SM08B-SRSS-TB** (J1). Pin-to-net mapping extracted from the schematic (net labels at the connector pins):

| Pin | Net | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | +BATT | Battery positive |
| 2 | GND | Ground |
| 3 | /CURR | Current-sense telemetry (INA186 output) |
| 4 | *(unconnected)* | No dedicated telemetry pin — telemetry handled by extended DShot |
| 5 | /M1 | DShot signal, channel 1 |
| 6 | /M2 | DShot signal, channel 2 |
| 7 | /M3 | DShot signal, channel 3 |
| 8 | /M4 | DShot signal, channel 4 |

Connector ground returns on the shield/mounting pads P1/P2 (both GND). The same eight signals are also broken out as direct solder pads (U3). Pin 4 — the dedicated telemetry pin on the Betaflight 8-pin standard — is intentionally unconnected: ESC→FC telemetry is carried over the motor signal lines via the bidirectional **extended DShot** protocol.

## Variants and revisions

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `hardware/4in1.kicad_pro` / `.kicad_pcb` / `.kicad_sch` | Main design (30×30). |
| `hardware/4in1-panel.kicad_pro` / `.kicad_pcb` | Panelized version for production fabrication. |

This repo is the 30×30 member of the OpenESC family; the 20×20 sibling lives in [`OpenESC_20X20`](https://github.com/incutec-hw/OpenESC_20X20). Production exports in `hardware/production/` are versioned `V0.1`–`V0.4` and `Rev1`. `Rev1-30x30` is the 30×30-only fabrication set; `Rev1-30x3020x20` is a combined shared-fab set produced alongside the mini.

## Firmware

[AM32](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware) — incutec's default ESC firmware. Boards ship with the AM32 bootloader pre-loaded; firmware is flashed and configured in-browser at [am32.ca](https://am32.ca). Each channel's AT32F421G8U7 is an independent AM32 target. The AT32F421 + NSG2065Q per-channel topology and the DShot signal nets are the standard AM32 4-in-1 hardware target. Works with Betaflight and other DShot-capable flight controllers.
